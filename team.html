                <p>Our organising team is made up of enthusiastic volunteers who are dedicated to the cause of creating
                    opportunities for the youth to get to know the field of computer science. Many organsiers are
                    tutoring students or are taking part in talent development as a hobby beside their career in
                    computer science.<br>
                    We believe that today's mainstream methods of education are not suitable for portraying computer
                    science as an interesting and fun field, which is why we want to use our decades of experience in
                    teaching to popularize new ways of approaching informatics.<br>
                    This challenge is one step in that direction. Our contestants will experience that the problems that
                    arise in the life of a programmer can be fun and enjoyable.

                            Mathematics has been my passion ever since my childhood, I have succesfully participated in
                            a lot of contests as a high schooler.
                            I had obtained my Érettségi at the special mathematics class of the Fazekas Mihály Primary
                            and Secondary Grammar School
                            of Budapest, after which I continued my studies as a mathematician at ELTE, with a PhD at
                            abstract algebra on the
                            Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne university in École, Switzerland. After a couple of
                            years, I have abandoned research to pursue a career in web development in France.<br><br>
                            Besides mathematics, I have always been very interested in teaching and nurturing talent.
                            I have taken part in organizing the Medve Outdoors Mathematics Competition in Hungary every
                            year since 2008.
                            As one of the founding members of the A Matematika Összeköt Egyesület in Hungary, I have
                            been teaching interested students mathematics for more than a decade.<br><br>
                            As a hobby, I read a lot about biology and psychology, and do a lot of exercise: my
                            favourite sports are hiking, wakeboard, wall climbing and pole sports.

                            I enjoy thinking about the structure and organisation of English and other languages. To me,
                            there are many parallels in the ways linguists go about thinking about the syntax (grammar)
                            of natural languages and the ways programmers issue computers instructions through the
                            medium of code — which is in many ways a language of its own.

                            My pastimes include constructing linguistic diagrams, teaching, keeping fit, and spending
                            time outdoors — walking about zoos and gardens.

                            I received a top distinction in my state for. Outside of academics, I’ve performed flute and
                            piccolo at Carnegie Hall, and finished top 3 in my state’s chess competition twice. Other

                            extracurricular during high school has been playing the cello, and have achieved numerous
                            awards such as winning the 2021 DePaul Concerto Competition and serving as principal cellist
                            for the 2020 Illinois Music and Education Conference Honors Orchestra. I served for three
                            years as a member of Midwest Young Artist Conservatory’s Young Scholars Program, supervising
                            and mentoring low-income students in learning the cello. My main academic interests include
                            computer science, and this January I had the opportunity to collaborate with six other
                            members of the Stanford Association for Computer Machinery in designing a neural network
                            that could read symbols from a text description and match them to their corresponding

                            Hi, I'm Jia Wei, a first year Business Analytics student studying in the National University
                            of Singapore. I'm relatively new to the field of computing and I'm currently exploring the
                            different areas of computing. Currently, I aspire to work in financial or marketing
                            analytics. My hobbies are astronomy, playing all sorts games and recreational sports such as
                            badminton.

                            I'm Guanzhou, a computer science student at the National University of Singapore.

                            My journey in computer science has been exciting thus far and I look forward to exploring
                            more domains in computer science. I love problem solving and algorithmic thinking and I am
                            particularly interested in software engineering and quantitative finance fields.

                            In my free time, I enjoy playing chess and racket sports such as badminton and squash

                            Hello! I’m Alvin, a Year 1 student studying Computer Science at National University of
                            Singapore. In the past, I have participated in a few Math Olympiad and Physics Olympiad
                            competitions, and really enjoyed trying to solve those tough problems and feeling the rush
                            of learning new techniques and concepts. In computer science, these problems are much more
                            dynamic and interesting, which is why I am excited for this opportunity to bring the joy of
                            problem solving to kids! In my free time, I like playing badminton, cycling and just being
                            outdoors.
