            </h3>
            <p>
              Our organising team is made up of enthusiastic volunteers who are
              dedicated to the cause of creating opportunities for the youth to
              get to know the field of computer science. Many organsiers are
              tutoring students or are taking part in talent development as a
              hobby beside their career in computer science.<br />
              We believe that today's mainstream methods of education are not
              suitable for portraying computer science as an interesting and fun
              field, which is why we want to use our decades of experience in
              teaching to popularize new ways of approaching informatics.<br />
              This challenge is one step in that direction. Our contestants will
              experience that the problems that arise in the life of a
              programmer can be fun and enjoyable.

                  I am Nora Szoke, mathematician and web developer. Mathematics
                  has been my passion ever since my childhood, I have
                  succesfully participated in a lot of contests as a high
                  schooler. I had obtained my Érettségi at the special
                  mathematics class of the Fazekas Mihály Primary and Secondary
                  Grammar School of Budapest, after which I continued my studies
                  as a mathematician at ELTE, with a PhD at abstract algebra on
                  the Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne university in École,
                  Switzerland. After a couple of years, I have abandoned
                  research to pursue a career in web development in France.<br /><br />
                  Besides mathematics, I have always been very interested in
                  teaching and nurturing talent. I have taken part in organizing
                  the Medve Outdoors Mathematics Competition in Hungary every
                  year since 2008. As one of the founding members of the A
                  Matematika Összeköt Egyesület in Hungary, I have been teaching
                  interested students mathematics for more than a decade.<br /><br />
                  As a hobby, I read a lot about biology and psychology, and do
                  a lot of exercise: my favourite sports are hiking, wakeboard,
                  wall climbing and pole sports.

                  competitive programming in these years, which has allowed me
                  to get bronze medals at the International Olympiad in
                  Informatics, the International Mathematical Olympiad, the
                  Central-European Olympiad in Informatics and a silver medal at
                  the Middle-European Olympiad in Mathematics.
                  <br /><br />
                  I was also successful in Hungarian competitions, I came second
                  in the Hungarian Olympiad in Informatics, and 10th on the
                  Hungarian Olympiad in Mathematics. In my final year at high
                  school, I started teaching in Alphacademy, where we teach
                  programming for hundreds of students. I have already had some
                  experience by that point, as I had already helped with
                  organising Pósa-camps as a high schooler.

                  <br />
                  Besides my school studies, I have been learning to code for a
                  long time in a self-taught way. I work for an ed-tech company
                  called Redmenta as a software engineer. Furthermore, I teach
                  C++ programming language and algorithms to students in
                  Alphacademy. Thanks to my American connections, I managed to
                  spend a semester in the United States, where besides
                  establishing new connections, I could improve my language
                  skills as well. With the help of my friend, we won 3rd prize
                  in the Hungarian Innovation Competition with our study about
                  decentralized logistics systems.

                  Hi! I’m Jeriel, a linguistics undergraduate student at the
                  University of Cambridge. I enjoy thinking about the structure
                  and organisation of English and other languages. To me, there
                  are many parallels in the ways linguists go about thinking
                  about the syntax (grammar) of natural languages and the ways
                  programmers issue computers instructions through the medium of
                  code — which is in many ways a language of its own. My
                  pastimes include constructing linguistic diagrams, teaching,
                  keeping fit, and spending time outdoors — walking about zoos
                  and gardens.

                  I'm Guanzhou, a computer science student at the National
                  University of Singapore. My journey in computer science has
                  been exciting thus far and I look forward to exploring more
                  domains in computer science. I love problem solving and
                  algorithmic thinking and I am particularly interested in
                  software engineering and quantitative finance fields. In my
                  free time, I enjoy playing chess and racket sports such as
                  badminton and squash

                  Hello! I’m Alvin, a Year 1 student studying Computer Science
                  at National University of Singapore. In the past, I have
                  participated in a few Math Olympiad and Physics Olympiad
                  competitions, and really enjoyed trying to solve those tough
                  problems and feeling the rush of learning new techniques and
                  concepts. In computer science, these problems are much more
                  dynamic and interesting, which is why I am excited for this
                  opportunity to bring the joy of problem solving to kids! In my
                  free time, I like playing badminton, cycling and just being
                  outdoors.

                  Hi! I’m Ellie, and I’m a second-year Computer Science
                  undergraduate at the University of Cambridge. I have always
                  had a very logical approach to life, which is why when my
                  high-school Informatics teacher told me my brain worked like a
                  computer, I knew I wanted to pursue computer science as a
                  career. I’m thoroughly enjoying my course and am currently on
                  the fence about whether I want to go into research or
                  industry. Only time will tell! I am an avid hiker and skier,
                  so I really love a good mountain, but you won’t hear me
                  complaining at the beach either!
